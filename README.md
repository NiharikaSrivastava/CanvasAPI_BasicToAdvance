This repository contains demos and a presentation for basics to advanced concepts of the Canvas API. Through the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Canvas API our team has created all these demos for a short presentation on Canvas API in Web Programming Subject at DAIICT, Gandhinagar (MSc IT - Semester 2).
Through the use of <canvas> element with HTML and JavaScript, we can create attractive graphics and enhance the visual appearance of any webpage. Starting from the basic concepts like Shapes, Grids, Text, Colors, Gradients and Patterns, we have also covered advanced concepts like animations, pixel manipulation, chroma keying and brick-breakout game. These insightful demos thoroughly elucidate all the above mentioned concepts.
